Course Overview
ECE 17: Object-Oriented Programming – Design and Development with C++
This course offers an extensive, advanced exploration of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, emphasizing design and development using the C++ programming language. With a focus on building efficient, scalable, and maintainable software systems, students will develop a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of OOP and data structures.

The course is structured to foster a deep understanding of programming paradigms and design principles through progressive learning modules, combining lectures, discussions, and hands-on assignments.

Topics Covered
Core C++ Fundamentals
The course begins with an in-depth dive into the foundational aspects of C++ programming:

Control Structures: Mastery of loops, conditionals, and branching techniques for implementing logical workflows.
Functions: Emphasis on modular design through parameterized functions, scope management, and return values.
Memory Management: Exploration of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and best practices for efficient resource utilization.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Building on core principles, the course delves into advanced OOP concepts:

Classes and Objects: Detailed coverage of encapsulation, constructors, destructors, and member functions.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Crafting flexible and reusable code structures using base and derived classes.
Encapsulation and Data Abstraction: Techniques to enhance modularity and protect data integrity.
Templates: Harnessing generic programming to create versatile and reusable components.
Data Structures and Algorithms
Students will implement and analyze a range of custom and built-in data structures:

Linked Lists: Implementation and traversal of singly and doubly linked lists.
Stacks and Queues: Application of these fundamental structures in problem-solving scenarios.
Binary Trees: Understanding hierarchical data organization, traversal methods, and basic operations.
Searching and Sorting Algorithms: Analysis and implementation of algorithms such as binary search, quicksort, mergesort, and their complexities.
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
Students will leverage the powerful STL to efficiently implement standard data structures and algorithms:

Containers: Vectors, maps, sets, and their practical applications.
Iterators: Streamlined traversal techniques for diverse data types.
Algorithms: Utilization of STL’s built-in functions for sorting, searching, and manipulation of data.
Advanced Topics
The latter half of the course focuses on integrating advanced programming techniques and tools:

File Handling: Managing input/output operations with CSV and other data formats.
Recursion: Implementing recursive solutions to complex problems, including tree traversal and backtracking.
Exception Handling: Designing robust applications that gracefully manage runtime errors.
Applications of Programming Concepts
Throughout the course, students will apply their knowledge to real-world problems:

Building modular and scalable codebases.
Debugging complex software systems.
Evaluating trade-offs in algorithm design and data structure selection.
Course Emphasis
This course aims to create not just proficient programmers but skilled developers who can:

Think Object-Oriented: Apply design principles to craft flexible and reusable code.
Handle Complexity: Solve challenging computational problems through efficient algorithms and well-chosen data structures.
Leverage C++ Effectively: Utilize advanced features of C++ to maximize performance and maintainability.
Bridge Theory and Practice: Integrate foundational knowledge with industry-relevant applications.
ECE 17 represents a comprehensive journey into object-oriented programming with C++, preparing students to tackle complex software development challenges with confidence and expertise.
